eclo-ar
=======

An augmented reality app for checking your eclo greenhouse status.

It allows to monitor sensor data and control the servo motor either via MQTT or AirVantage.<br>
I am in the process of making the code generic so there is a good chance you could monitor pretty much anything (i.e. not necessarily a greenhouse) with limited efforts! :)


The code is everything but perfect, especially since I have no particular Android knowledge, but hopefuly it is useful :)
Feel free to fork and/or suggest improvements! Also, I'll try to make a version available on Google Play soon.
